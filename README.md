# Predicting Box Office Revenue Using Sentiment Analysis of Early Reviews

**Overview:**

This project explores the relationship between early movie review sentiment and subsequent box office revenue.  We analyze sentiment scores derived from early reviews (simulated in this example,  real-world data integration would require API access) to build a predictive model for box office revenue. The goal is to demonstrate how sentiment analysis can be used to inform marketing strategies and optimize resource allocation.  This project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or similar NLP library -  replace if different library is used)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following output:

* **Console Output:**  Summary statistics of the data, model training details (e.g., accuracy scores, model coefficients), and final box office revenue predictions.
* **Plot Files:**  The script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `revenue_vs_sentiment.png`) illustrating the relationship between sentiment scores and box office revenue. These plots will be saved in the project's directory.

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data (CSV files, etc.).  *(Note:  This will likely need to be populated with your own data)*
* `src/`: Contains the Python source code for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
* `main.py`: The main script to run the analysis.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
* `results/`:  This folder will be created to hold output plots and other results


**Further Development:**

Future improvements could include:

* Integration with real-world review APIs (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes API).
* Exploration of more advanced machine learning models.
* Incorporation of additional features (e.g., genre, director, cast).
* Development of a user interface for easier interaction.
